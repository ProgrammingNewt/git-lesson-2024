To make a commit ("version" or "checkpoint") of your files, follow this procedure: 

1. Make changes to your project that you would like to keep.
2. When you have your changes, tell `git` you are ready to create a checkpoint of the file using the `git add FILENAME` command.
3. Create a checkpoint of the file you're using using `git commit -m "Message about what you did"`.

To create and swtich to a branch. use the command:

`git switch -c NEW_BRANCH-NAME`

`git switch BRANCH_NAME`
